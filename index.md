Hi, I am a fourth-year CS Ph.D. student at UNC Charlotte, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Dong Dai](https://daidong.github.io) on storage systems.
My research aims to build a high-performance graph processing engine to support trillion-edge graph processing in a single machine with heterogeneous memory/storage architecture. I exploit emerging storage technologies (e.g., Persistent Memory) in this regard. I am particularly interested in developing intelligent and adaptive data structures to efficiently store dynamic graphs without sacrificing the graph analysis’s efficiency.

Prior to UNC Charlotte, I was appointed as Principal Software Engineer at [TigerIT Bangladesh Ltd.](https://www.tigerit.com) where I led a couple of ML and data management related engineering projects. I obtained my bachelor’s degree from [University of Dhaka](https://www.cse.du.ac.bd).
